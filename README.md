# Matching Game

## How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript (jQuery)

*Test your memory with a simple yet fun card game. The object of the game is to remove all 6 pairs of matching cards.*

Creating this game I started in HTML where I made a div container to center the cards with. Then I created 12 sections, two for each matching pair. I gave these sections classes of both card and unmatched and later defined these classes in CSS, during this step most syling for the project was applied. Next came the OOP jQuery, I created an object called game and encapsulated functions necessary for the game to work.

## Optimizations:

When I find the time I would also like to add a larger selection of words to match along with the ability for matched cards to remain in view.

## Lessons Learned:

Going forward I will not be styling before completing the Javascript.
